Django Installation

Open Command Prompt

pip install django

------------------------

Start new Django project

//check the list available subcommands
django-admin

------------------------

Django considers all projects to be collection of apps
Our project directory is called mysite and mysite is also the primary app
Role of the primary app is to link other apps
Besides managing settings and urls not much is done there

Add an app to our project

We use manage.py helper python script to start new app
Navigate to the directory where manage.py is located
Enter the command --> python manage.py startapp main <-- to start new app
A new directory by the name of main is created at the location

Project Structure

mysite
    -main (directory, your new app)
    -mysite (directory, this is your "primary" app)
    -manage.py (helper python script)

Run server using manage.py

Open another Command Prompt window
Enter the command --> python manage.py runserver <-- to run the server
We will see something like
/////
